### Types

* Static and random template-based fuzzers

* Block-based fuzzers:

* Dynamic generation or evolution based fuzzers

* Model-based or simulation-based fuzzers


### case to penetrate the application logic.


1. decode input, check syntax
2. check semantics
3. update state, generate output

********************Fully model based Fuzzer**********************************

module simulate/emulate

Protocol modeler - grammar Antlr4, etc

Anomaly library - collections of inputs known to trigger vulnerabilities in software,
    whereas others just use random data
    
Attack simulation engine - Uses a library of attacks or anomalies, or learns from one.
    The anomalies collected into the tool, or random modifications, are applied to the model
    to generate the actual fuzz tests.

Runtime analysis engine - Monitors the SUT. Various techniques can be used to interact with the SUT and
    to instrument and control the target and its environment.

Reporting - bug reporting engines

### Process

#### Responses

* Valid response.

* Error response (may still be valid from a protocol standpoint).

* Anomalous response (unexpected but nonfatal reaction, such as slowdown
  or responding with a corrupted message).

* Crash or other failure.
